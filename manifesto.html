<b>the manifesto you write while wearing mens deodorant.exe</b><br>
<br>
so i feel like manifestos have a lot of exclamation points<br>
every sentence is 4 words followed by an exclamation point<br>
and look<br>
to be honest i have never earnestly used an exclamation point<br>
an exclamation point is a lie punctuation tells itself at the beginning of a car crash<br>
its going to be okay exclamation point<br>
when i speak every sentence is followed by nothing<br>
not even a period<br>
so i am suspending the use of proper grammar and punctuation in this manifesto<br>
and it is my manifesto<br>
so<br>
im also ending every sentence with a semi colon;<br>
because it is like committing a tiny infraction;<br>
and i love tiny infractions;<br>
it also makes each line like a piece of code;<br>
i will save it in your head as a .exe file;<br>
in a folder with a million copies of itself;<br>
just untitled.exe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 i would put periods here to indicate more but im going to be stubborn;<br>
but get this;<br>
i dont want you to ever run it;<br>
just delete one copy everyday;<br>
until you reach the end of time;<br>
<br>
so now that we got that out of the way;<br>
i want to tell you the kind of person i am going to be while writing this manifesto;<br>
when i was driving into my apartment complex yesterday there was a kid laying right inside the gate in the middle of the road;<br>
and it was like my brain was completely unprepared for that thing to ever happen;<br>
to drive up to a kid who goes outside and just lies down just inside the main gate of an apartment complex;<br>
im sadly not that kid right now;<br>
but my brain is still reeling from trying to apply its internal models instincts and whatever;<br>
to that kid in the road;<br>
i mean he got up but still;<br>
im a person who lived through an event that nature hadnt really thought of when it was putting shit together;<br>
ive got some rearranging to do;<br>
<br>
heres another thing;<br>
im wearing mens deodorant right now;<br>
mine crumbled into a million pieces of ugh why this morning;<br>
so i went for my boyfriends;<br>
its got some name like cool ocean chrome wrench and everything is in a really fast font;<br>
ok its like when they try to explain the speed of light on a tv show;<br>
and they speed the footage up and have red and blue trails of the moving object;<br>
and its david attenborough just zooming around you a million times on a tuscan hillside for some reason;<br>
the speed of light and mens deodorant are equal;<br>
it is math and it is true;<br>
i know this because it makes me sweat probably more than if i werent wearing deodorant;<br>
which makes no sense so some part of me must be moving really fast;<br>
but it is too fast for me to know it ever left;<br>
im on the tuscan hillside and molecules from my armpits are firing all around me;<br>
its actually probably some scheme to pay women less by making men sweat more;<br>
show me the graph for mens sweat and average income;<br>
then show me exactly all of the science involved in men and womens deodorant;<br>
i want diagrams of sweat glands and chemical formulas;<br>
give me all the data now;<br>
i want the world to seep in and out of my pores;<br>
<br>
when i cry around someone who intimidates me;<br>
i really want them to know i am just a human with a weird cry cycle;<br>
here is a diagram of it that is just arrows going in a circle and each one pointing to the word cry;<br>
for instance i cried in the dog food aisle of target this week;<br>
i saw a bird perched on the metal rack for baby clothes;<br>
and it looked like it was in the biggest ugliest cage it could have ever found;<br>
you have to remember glass is terrible witchcraft for birds;<br>
their speed and neck position makes the confusion over real and shiny real completely fatal;<br>
then to die in the bowels of target of all places;<br>
not in a battle with a red tailed hawk against a clear sky;<br>
instead shitting on baby clothes and constantly fleeing from the shopping carts charging towards a goal abstracted from predator and prey;<br>
so i remembered that the dog food aisle is the aisle best for hiding 20 jewel case cds under your jacket;<br>
before you bolt out the sliding doors past the cameras into your moms getaway car;<br>
source internet;<br>
but it is also the best aisle for 20 minutes of pure cry;<br>
source me;<br>
<br>
i dont know;<br>
arent manifestos like mostly for murderers now;<br>
the type with dated html websites;<br>
bright green courier font on a black background;<br>
and the media finds them after some terrible act is committed;<br>
and the dated web counter at the bottom goes crazy;<br>
can i just be a generally confused person without yelling ever;<br>
or having to define my borders strictly;<br>
i just want to exist around myself and not inside myself;<br>
i want to seep out of my own pores and never let myself back in;<br>
and i guess thats really it;<br>
ok i will stop being horrible;
